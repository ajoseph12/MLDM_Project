Intorduction
------------

- Sequence Mining- Hence we'll implement machine learning and data mining approaches. For mining approachs, sequence mining algorithms 
must be used. The algo must track the main patterns which are representative of each class of digits. This is doen in an unsupervised way as we don't want learn a classifier, rather only extract the most important patterns. 
- Metric Learning - According to the repsentation we learn from sequence minig, a metric learning algo should be implemented, eg: apply LMNN - implement at least one algo (implementations exist in matlab and python). During defence, methodological questions will also be posed.  
- Deep Learning - Used only to generate features/ learn latent space. DO NOT learn classifier. The new features can be used with KNN algo.


Dataset Creation 
----------------

- Dataset ought to be created using ones own environment to create digits. 
- You can also merge created dataset with SOTA dataset like [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
- You can also generate your own datasets using GANZ - adverserial methods


Dataset Representation
----------------------
- Structured way : in the form of sequences. We wiil have to implement an algo based on Freeman's Code. 
	⋅⋅*  The idea is, you have a matrix of pixels, we begin at the top left of the matrix. Once you 
- Numerical way : using Deep Learning
