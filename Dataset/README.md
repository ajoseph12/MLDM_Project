# Created Dataset

The train dataset was creating by:
- Using 30000 randomly picked instances from the MNIST dataset
- Using 20000 instances generated using an autoencoder 
- Using 10000 instances generated using DCGAN
- train_X - a 60000 x 1 x 28 x 28 tensor : features 
- train_y - a 60000 x 1 tensor : labels
    
The test dataset was created by:
- Using 5000 randomly picked instances from the MNIST dataset
- Using 2500 instances generated using an autoencoder 
- Using 2500 instances generated using DCGAN
- test_X - a 10000 x 1 x 28 x 28 tensor : features 
- test_Y - a 10000 x 1 tensor : labels
